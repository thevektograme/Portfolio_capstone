# Portfolio_capstone
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a sales forecasting model using the R programming language. The goal is to predict future sales based on historical data and various factors that influence sales performance. The project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and evaluation.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

1. R programming language installed on your machine.
2. RStudio or any other preferred integrated development environment (IDE).
3. Relevant R packages, such as tidyverse, forecast, pacman, openxlsx, modeltime, parsnip, rsample, timetk, broom, ggthemes, catools, dplyr, tseries.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data**: This folder contains the dataset used for sales forecasting. Ensure that the dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel) and located in this folder.

2. **Script**: This folder contains the R scripts used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation. The scripts are named in a logical order to guide you through the project.

This folder also stores the trained models generated during the project. It is recommended to save the models for future reference and reproducibility.
3. **PLots**: These folders contain the output files, such as visualizations and performance metrics, obtained from the project. It helps in tracking the progress and documenting the findings.

5. **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for running the code.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required R packages mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

3. Place the sales dataset in the "Data" folder.

4. Open RStudio or your preferred IDE and set the project directory as the working directory.

5. Run the R scripts in the "Scripts" folder in the specified order to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation.

6. Examine the results generated in the "Results" folder, including visualizations and performance metrics.

7. Modify and experiment with the code as needed to improve the sales forecasting model.

## Additional Resources
For additional resources and references related to sales forecasting in R, consider the following:

- Online tutorials and documentation for R programming language.
- Books and courses on time series analysis and forecasting.
- R packages documentation, such as `forecast` and `caret`.

## Conclusion
This readme file provides an overview of the sales forecasting project in R programming language. By following the instructions and utilizing the provided resources, you can successfully develop a sales forecasting model and gain valuable insights into future sales performance.
